# Rat-in-a-maze

By backtracking



                   Algorithm -

1. Create a solution matrix, initially filled with 0â€™s.
2. Create a recursive function which takes the initial matrix, output matrix and position of rat(i,j).
3. If the positon output is out of the matrix or the position is not valid then return.
4. Mark the position output[i][j] as 1 and check of the current position is destination or not. If destination is reached print the output matrix and return.
5. Recursively call for position (i+1, j) and (i, j+1).
6. Unmark position(i,j), i.e output[i][j] = 0.
